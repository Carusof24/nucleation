We use molecular dynamics simulations to study crystal nucleation in supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids, 
comparing two order parameters: the global potential energy and the local slope of the radial distribution function (RDF). 

A threshold-based analysis shows that the RDF slope detects nucleation earlier, 
reflecting local structural reorganization before a significant drop in potential energy. 
When computing free energy barriers, the slope parameter also exhibits smaller standard deviations, indicating more robust sampling of metastable states. 

Overall, these results suggest that the slope of the RDF provides a more reliable and sensitive measure of the nucleation process than global potential energy, 
offering clearer insights into the early stages of crystallization in simple fluids.

Our findings reveal that, although both parameters successfully detect the transition caused by the nucleation event, 
the slope parameter offers several clear advantages:

Higher Sensitivity to Early Structural Changes. 
The slope of the RDF captures local rearrangements more directly than the global potential energy.

As a result, it often signals the onset of nucleation earlier in the simulation. More Consistent Free Profiles. 
When computing free energy, we observed that the slope parameter yields smaller standard deviations across different replicas. 
This implies more reliable sampling and suggests that the slope is less susceptible to statistical noise than the potential energy.

Overall, the slope parameter serves as a more robust and precise indicator of the nucleation process in supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids. 
Future work could explore a combination of structural and thermodynamic indicators, possibly integrating advanced sampling techniques, 
to gain deeper insights into the complex dynamics of nucleation in supercooled fluids.
